Since you're here, I assume that you want to learn about me! That's great and all, but if you're coming here from [Rec Room](docs\Info\RecRoom.md), I recommend that you click the platform's respective hyperlink and read that page first. They may answer your questions and save you some time! Now for the rest of you,,,

Hey! I'm dukedotdev and I do a *lot* of stuff! I'm a 17 y/o trans girl who loves gaming, cybersecurity, developing things, and more!

## Gaming

For PC gaming, I use Steam. I own a desktop with Linux Mint 22 Cinnamon and a 512GB Steam Deck [Non-OLED]. Some of my favorite games are [Dead by Daylight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/), [PAYDAY 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/), [Rec Room](https://store.steampowered.com/app/471710/Rec_Room/), [Mirror's Edge Catalyst](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233570/Mirrors_Edge_Catalyst/), [Escape the Backrooms](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943950/Escape_the_Backrooms/), [Cruelty Squad](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1388770/Cruelty_Squad/), and [BIGFOOT](https://store.steampowered.com/app/509980/BIGFOOT/).

For those interested, below are my system's specs!

I do play on a Switch, but I only play Splatoon 3 on it. Since I own a hacked Switch, I've dumped all my other games and just run them on yuzu. If you want to add me though, feel free to via this friend code: ``SW-6190-5465-5039``

## Cybersecurity / Web & Game Dev

The cybersecurity part of this is currently more of a dream than an actual hobby of mine ðŸ˜…. I've done some ethical hacking in my free time before and have participated in Rec Room's Bugcrowd program, but I'm *far* from making it my actual job. This is the same for the web & game dev part too, but I've got a little more practice with those aspects. I've been making websites and tinkering with code since I was 8 and I still love it to this day! All of my old websites are long gone, but I'm currently managing two. One you're [currently on](https://dukedot.dev), and the other is [magiquest.wiki](https://magiquest.wiki)! Both are made using Docusaurus, mainly because I don't have the time to make a pure and original HTML, JS, and CSS *thing*. I've done it before, but working with a builder is much faster. On the game dev front, I've made some games in Rec Room and I've played around in Unity, Godot, and Unreal. This includes having [made PAYDAY 3 mods!](docs\Projects\Payday3Mods\index.mdx).

## Other

Not much I haven't talked about other than my obsession with MagiQuest. Have you heard about it? No? Head over [here](https://magiquest.wiki) and then come back after looking through :]
