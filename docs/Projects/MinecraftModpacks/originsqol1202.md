## Description

This is a modpack running on 1.20.2 that focuses around the [Origins](https://github.com/apace100/origins-fabric) mod and includes many other [QoL](https://github.com/Serilum/Tree-Harvester), [visual](https://github.com/Mirsario/Minecraft-CameraOverhaul), and [performance](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium) mods to further enhance the experience. With easy-to-host multiplayer through [Essential](https://essential.gg/), it's a great way to play with your friend group!

:::warning

This modpack ***may be missing files*** when using install methods other than Prism Launcher! Prototype testers reported missing Resource Packs and Shader Packs when using the CurseForge install method, but could be worse than determined. The Modrinth version hasn't been tested but *is* suspected to contain the same issue. A version for Prism Launcher that doesn't have this problem **is** available for download.

## Instructions

### Primary [Prism Launcher] Install Guide

:::tip Recommended Install Method

This installation method is the easiest and requires ***no*** post-installation configuration. Use this method if you're new to modding or not comfortable debugging post-install issues.
 
:::

#### 1. Installing Prism Launcher

The Prism Launcher website provides [official documentation](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/) on how to install and configure their launcher. Please go to their site and read the [Installing Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-prismlauncher/) and [Installing Java](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/) sections, then return here.

#### 2. Importing the Modpack

Click on the Add Instance button on the top menu bar, or right-click an empty area in the middle of the launcher, and select Create instance. You should now see a sidebar to the left of the Create Instance window. Click on the tab named Import with a folder icon, and press the Browse button to the right of the embedded URL bar. In the newly opened file explorer, navigate to the downloaded .ZIP file. Click on it to select it, and then press the Select button on the bottom-right of your file manager. You can now click the OK button on the bottom-right of the New Instance window to finalize the instance.

#### 3. Launching the instance

Double click on the instance's icon in the middle of the launcher, click on the Launch button on the right overview bar, or right-click the instance's icon and select Launch.

### Alternate Version [CurseForge] Install Guide

:::danger

This modpack has been ***confirmed to be missing files***! If possible, please use the [Prism Launcher Install Guide](https://dukedot.dev/projects/minecraftmodpacks/originsqol1202#primary-prism-launcher-install-guide). Do ***not*** expect this install method to work without applying manual fixes.

Beyond this point, you are expected to understand the basics of modding Minecraft, at least intermediate debugging knowledge, and cannot hand-hold you through fixing post-install issues.
