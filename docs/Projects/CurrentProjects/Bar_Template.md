## Disclaimer

This map was ***not*** built by me [@dukedotdev](https://rec.net/user/dukedotdev), but by [@piepanda](https://rec.net/user/piepanda). I was a co-owner in the original map and copied it before it got taken down. If someone claims you stole a map, I recommend you point them to this disclaimer.
