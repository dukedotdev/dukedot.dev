Below are RR clans / militaries that I've previously worked on.

## [^Desert-Force-Military](https://rec.net/room/Desert-Force-Military)

From November 1st, 2022 to April 30th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in DFM. On April 30th, after placing first in that month's Room Rewards, all of the original owners were removed and replaced due to the [owner](https://rec.net/user/progamerdudeyt)'s negligence.

## [^Viper_MilitaryRR](https://rec.net/room/Viper_MilitaryRRS) (Now Known As ^Viper_MilitaryRRS)

From August 19th, 2022 to June 9th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in VM. After a disagreement on payment with the [owner](https://rec.net/user/piepanda) at the time, I left the project and cut all ties with him.
