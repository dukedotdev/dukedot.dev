From November 1st, 2022 to April 30th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in DFM. On April 30th, after placing first in that month's Room Rewards, all of the original owners were removed and replaced due to the [owner](https://rec.net/user/progamerdudeyt)'s negligence.

From August 19th, 2022 to June 9th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in VM. After a disagreement on payment with the [owner](https://rec.net/user/piepanda) at the time, I left the project and cut all ties with him.

From August 13th, 2022 to February 8th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in GTS. The project had found minimal success, with the majority of room visits being from the team. The last published update was December 24th, 2022, and all unpublished levels are in a release limbo.

From April 23rd, 2023 to August 7th, 2023, I was the lead circuiteer in the project. Being worked on in the background to help a friend learn the ropes of room creation, I provided the map's base, originally from the first part of the fourth level in GTS, and all the circuits. The map was edited by the owner, and she learned how to do some basic building. After completion and publication, we both decided to not update it any further.

### Projects I'm Actively Working On

A still relativly new project, magiquest.wiki is a mirror site of [magiquest.fandom.com](https://magiquest.fandom.com). On behalf of the MQ-VR organization, I started work on the project September 9th, 2023. The rest of the team aren't interested in maintaning it, so I'm managing the site solo with help from the general MagiQuest community.

March 22nd, 2023, I created a room called ^MagiQuest-RR. After inviting a few friends to join in the creation of the room, our scope grew much bigger, and so did our team. In June, we became an organization and changed our internal structure. Since we've became a co-op, I've moved from Owner to a Project Manager. We're currently in the process of creating a tech demo to showcase our work.
